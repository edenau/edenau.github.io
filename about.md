<h4>Background</h4>

This is Eden Au. My journey started when I took IT classes in high school where I learned how to code (in Pascal 🐆 for some reasons). My hard work paid off as I was awarded silver medal 🥈 and distinction in Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics (Senior Group) and Canadian Computing Competition respectively. I built a [School Internal Examination Seating Arrangement System 💯💺]({{ site.url }}/exam-sitting) for secondary schools in Hong Kong in my final year.

I went for Engineering in university as I like solving problems. I chose Oxford as they offered two years of general engineering courses, and I chose University College (Univ) as they have the best tutors (<a href="https://www.univ.ox.ac.uk/academics/stephen-collins/" target="_blank">Dr. Steve Collins</a> is one of the best). Engineering science is a very broad field, it includes civil, mechanical, electrical, electronic, material, biomedical, chemical, information etc., and I learned the basics of structures, fluids, thermodynamics, engineering computation, energy systems etc.. I decided to do Information Engineering 📟 and focused on <i>a) machine learning 🎰🤔, b) control theory 🎮, and c) signal processing 🚦</i>.

I developed several algorithms and applications during my time in Oxford. I made [a simple Android app 📱]({{ site.url }}/checkpoint) such that everyone can explore a city easily, [a simple algorithm that calibrates a pinhole camera 📷]({{ site.url }}/camera-calibration), and [a distributed optimization algorithm for increasing service level of station-based bike sharing systems 🚴]({{ site.url }}/bike-sharing).

I was an active university member. I was the Vice-President of Oxford Hong Kong Society, a researcher in OxPolicy: the Oxford Student Think Tank, and a founding member of Oxford Coding Society (help spread the love of coding 💌). I also took the opportunity to gain more experience in data science. Go to my <a href="{{ site.url }}/resume/">resume</a> for more details.

After 4 years of undergraduate study in Oxford, I went to Edinburgh in September 2018 for my PhD study. I am now focused on leveraging machine learning in climate modeling ⛈️. In particular, I am developing a machine learning-based convection parameterization scheme to predict convective events in a more accurate and efficient manner. Since I did general engineering before, I believe it is well-handled. I am now looking for different opportunities to gain more experience in data science (please contact me if you have something to offer!).

<h4>Interest</h4>

My research interest includes applying data science in natural sciences and real life applications. One particular interest would be developing physics-informed machine learning models where known physics and prior knowledge are incorporated, such as conservation laws.

I believe we can all contribute to our society 🗺️ in various means. I was a mentor in Boundless where I provided mentorship to under-resourced students that facilitated their personal growth, and training that equipped them with skills that could help them succeed in their respective pursuits. I have also been working in Project Access Hong Kong for more than 2 years to help talented less-privileged young people around the globe achieve their academic goals.

I am also a writer on <a href="https://medium.com/@edenau" target="_blank">Towards Data Science – Medium</a>. I love sharing my experience and provide guidance to people. If you think I would be a great addition to your company/organization/team, please contact me 🤙! Here is my [résumé]({{ site.url }}/resume).

<h4>Fun facts</h4>

<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/hawking.jpeg" target="_blank">Stephen Hawking visited me.</a>

In general, I am interested in a) data science (machine learning, control theory, signal processing, blockchain), b) technology (Internet of things), c) natural science (atmospheric physics, astrophysics), d) linguistics (phonological mappings among Chinese languages), and e) policy making.
