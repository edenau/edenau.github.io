>> Why don’t rich football clubs just buy most of the big names on the market?

In order to prevent football clubs from stockpiling talents and to promote the development of local youth players, football clubs cannot buy and register whoever they want in their team. We have heard terms like ‘homegrown players’ and ‘squad registration rules’ on the news for so long, but what do they mean?

There are different registration rules for each league, and those rules are changing, hard to find, and sometimes quite complicated. In light of this, here is a summary of the squad registration rules for the top 4 levels of English league and European leagues.

<i>The following information is correct for 2019/20 season.</i>

## Technicality

- <b>A year</b>: an entire season or 12 months, whichever satisfies the criterion
- <b>Turning 15</b>: the <i>start</i> of the season during which they turn 15
- <b>Turning 21</b>: the <i>end</i> of the season during which they turn 21
- <b>Under-21 (or 19)</b>: under-21 (or under-19) on 31 December of the <i>previous</i> season
For example, U21 (or U19) players will have been born on or after 1 January 1998 (or 1 January 2000) in 2019/20 season [1]

# 1. English Premier League

Introduced at the beginning of the 2010–11 season [2], a team in the English Premier League (EPL) can register
- Maximum of <b>25 senior players</b>, in which
Maximum of <b>17 non-homegrown senior players</b>, and
- <b>Unlimited U21 players</b>.

Players are considered as ‘<b>homegrown (HG)</b>’ if and only if they were registered with clubs affiliated with the English FA and/or Welsh FA <b>at least 3 years before turning 21</b>, continuous or not, regardless of their nationality or age.

<i>Rules do not apply on all domestic cups.</i>

## Case Study

The homegrown rule means a team needs to register <b>8</b> homegrown senior players if all 25 registration quota is utilized. A team does not need to use up all quota, and this is not uncommon among the ‘elite’ clubs.

- Spanish player Cesc Fàbregas spent more than 3 years in Arsenal before turning 21, and is HG even when he played for Chelsea at the age of 31.
- English player Eric Dier plays for Tottenham Hotspur. He was trained in Sporting CP in Portugal before 21, and is therefore non-HG.

<div class="breaker"></div> <a id="2"></a>

# 2. English Football League

Amended at the beginning of 2018/19 season, on an <b>18-player team sheet</b> in <i>every</i> league or playoff match, a team in the Championship, League One, or League Two has to <b>nominate</b>

- Minimum of <b>7 homegrown players</b> [3], and
- Minimum of <b>1 club-developed player OR name up to 6 substitutes</b> (rather than 7) in the game

A ‘club-developed’ player is defined as one who has been registered to the club <b>for at least a year before the end of his under-19 season</b> [4].

<i>Rules do not apply on all domestic cups.</i>

<div class="breaker"></div> <a id="3"></a>

# 3. UEFA Competitions

From 2008/09 season, a team in the group stage of UEFA Champions League (UCL) or Europa League (UEL) can register

<b>List A:</b>
- Maximum of <b>25 players</b>, <b>2</b> of whom must be <b>goalkeepers</b>, in which
Maximum of <b>21 non-club-trained players</b>, in which
Maximum of <b>17 non-association-trained players</b>, and

<b>List B:</b>
- <b>Unlimited U21 <i>club</i> players</b>.

Players are <b>‘club-trained’</b> if and only if they were registered with the clubs <b>at least 3 years between 15 and 21</b>, continuous or not, regardless of their nationality or age.

Players are <b>‘association-trained’</b> if and only if they satisfy the same criteria but with <b>clubs in the same FA</b> [5]. That means club-trained players are association-trained, but the reverse is not necessarily true.

<b>U21 <i>club</i> players</b> are players under-21 and have been eligible to play <b>for the club for any continuous period of 2 years since turning 15</b>. That means players aged 16 can be registered if they have been registered with the club for the previous 2 years.

As of the round of 32, a team can register

- <b>3 new players</b>, and
- respect the abovementioned quota

If the registration of new players causes failure in complying with List A quota, the club must remove a necessary number of currently registered players such that the quota is respected.

## Cup-tied rule

UEFA competition had a complex cup-tied rule as teams can switch between competitions. Before 2005/06, no players could play for a second club whatsoever in UEFA matches in a season. UEFA then permitted players to move between competitions in the winter transfer window (January). From 2012/13, players who had played in the qualifying rounds can play for another club in the group stage. [6]

Starting 2018/19 season, <b>newly registered players are allowed to have been fielded for another club</b> in any stage of any UEFA competition. A player can now be a winner and a runner-up in the same season, or a winner for both competitions.

## Case Study

- Newly signed under-21 players are not eligible for List B as they have not spent a continuous period of 2 years in their new clubs.
- At the beginning of 2011/12 season, Manchester City threatened Arsenal that they would not get Samir Nasri if he participated in Arsenal’s UCL qualifiers, which would make him cup-tied in City. He did not participate and the deal went through.
- In January 2018, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joined Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund. The Gunners were in UEL, and Dortmund finished third in their UCL group and therefore dropped into the UEL. Aubameyang then became ineligible for Arsenal for the rest of the season. Had Dortmund finished in a different position in their group, he would have been eligible for playing for Arsenal in UEL.

# Takeaway

While EPL and UEFA games have similar squad registration rules, football teams usually face more difficulties in registering players for European games than for domestic matches. The UEFA seems to have slightly stricter regulations on

1. requirement on club-trained players,
2. definition of U21 players, and
3. the quota for newly registered players in the winter transfer window.

For example, the then 18-year-old Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku joined Chelsea at the beginning of 2011/12 season. While he was eligible for domestic games as a U21 player without registration, he was not eligible for UEFA List B and was left out of UEFA List A since the list was filled up with senior players already.
