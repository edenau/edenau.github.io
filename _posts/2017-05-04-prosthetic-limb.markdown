# Introduction

Prosthetics are designed to help amputees restore the basic functions of their missing limb. Currently, there are an estimated 1.6 million people living with limb loss in the United States and this number could double by 2050 [1].This is due to the combined effect of population growth and a rise in the incidence of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease [2].

With rapid developments in technology, amputees view their physical limitations as something which can be solved. At Tius prosthetics we hope our product provides for this evolving market looking for ‘function over form’.

Today’s prosthetic market provides a wide range of solutions appreciating that each user’s needs are different. Devices are grouped under passive, manual, body powered and electric with customers including NHS (and other healthcare providers), charities and individuals.

The solutions available for transradial users are less extensive. User’s find themselves split between a lightweight, affordable, passive device and a heavy, expensive, electrical device. Much research has focused on reducing the weight of electrical models, however this often comes with a significant price-tag: 5-year electrical prosthetic costs are estimated to be $117,440 per person [3]. Consequently, we believe there is a gap in the transradial market for an electric prosthetic that is affordable, user friendly and lightweight.

# Specification

Key features of our design with include:

- A comfortable and secure socket suspension system which is simple to don
- A lightweight yet sufficiently strong forearm to house the electronics
- A manually manipulated locking wrist unit
- An electronic terminal device able to grasp objects of varying sizes, materials and masses
- A novel user interface in the form of a ring on the contralateral hand
- A battery management system designed for extended use and minimal charging time

Our design incorporates the above features into a single prosthetic. We believe giving it the potential to disrupt the transradial prosthetic market.

The design process began with a need identification. Which requirements did users feel the current market was failing to meet? Discussions with amputees revealed the following desires which are encompassed in our specification below.

Product Specification:
- To have a detachable yet electric terminal device
- To be able to carry at least 5 kg as a point load in the terminal device
- To be able to operate the terminal device using a ring in the contralateral hand
- To provide visual feedback when an item is gripped
- To have a minimum battery life of 10 hours (for a 9-5 jobs plus commute)
- To charge to 60% in two hours
- To be able to rotate and lock the wrist in 8 discrete positions
- For the total prosthetic to weigh under 1.5kg
- For the total prosthetic to cost under £1,000 with £350 raw material costs

This specification is accompanied by our overall product objective: to hold a pen, bike handle and pint of beer securely. Thus, permitting our user to live a typical student's life!

We will discuss each modular component in turn beginning with the socket and progressing to the distal end of the prosthetic where the terminal device and ring user interface are located. Each section, will outline the solutions and mechanisms researched and final design chosen. This will include a summary of the materials used, cost and mass, complete with justifications.

# Safety and Legal

## Overview

With any medical device that is being produced, safety is a very important factor to take into account. Globally, there are different regulations for different countries. In the United Kingdom (UK), European Union (EU) directives cover the sale and manufacture of prostheses. This is enforced by a branch of the government called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

The specific document covering the classification of prostheses is the Medical Devices Directive (MDD) [4] which includes guidance on classification of prosthetic devices.

Our prosthetic device will be a Class I Device with a CE marking. This CE marking states that the product complies with EU health, safety and environmental protection legislation. It also allows the product to be legally placed on the market in any EU country as well as allowing free movement through the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the EU.

A prosthetic is classified in two parts by the MHRA. The first is the socket and the second is the hardware. The hardware is all of the components up to the socket. Some of these may be individually CE marked and some may be custom made pieces. None of the components will be custom made in our hardware as this will add to the cost of the prosthetic and does not fit with the brief for an 'affordable' prosthetic.

## Classification
Classification of medical devices is covered by Article 9 of the MDD. The article directs to annex IX which provides a list of definitions for the classification of devices. The definitions that apply to our device are:
- Long Term – “Normally intended for use for more than 30 days”
- Active Medical Device – “Any medical device operation of which depends on a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human body or gravity and which acts by converting this energy”

Rule 1 states that all non-invasive devices are class I unless any of the other rules are broken. This is not the case for our device so, based on invasiveness, the device will be in class I. Rules 9 through 12 detail additional rules for active devices. None of rules 9 through 11 apply and so based on rule 12, our device remains in class I.

## Reporting of Incidents following Marketing of Product
Article 10 of the MDD outlines the procedure for reporting of incidents in which the prosthesis is required to be recalled or there is a “malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of the device”. In such a case it is required for the manufacturer to contact the relevant authority in the member state, ie MHRA, and to conduct an investigation. From there, the MHRA will deal with reporting on the investigation to the European Council.

## Assessment of Conformity
Since the class of device has been chosen, the next task is to make sure that the device conforms to the required standards. This is laid out in article 11 of the MDD and outlines the procedures required to affix a CE-marking to the device. The “EC declaration of conformity” procedure for class I devices is outlined in Annex VII of the MDD.

As a manufacturer, the declaration of conformity and associated technical documentation must be made available to the relevant authorities in the member state, i.e. MHRA, for five years after the last date of manufacture of the devices.
The list of technical documentation required is as follows:
- A general description of the product/device
- Design drawings, manufacture methods and diagrams of sub-assemblies in the device, as
well as descriptions of how these work.
- A risk analysis accompanied by a list of the standards from the MDD which have been
applied
- The results of design calculations that prove the functionality of the device
- A pre-clinical evaluation
- A clinical evaluation in accordance with Annex X of the MDD
- Labelling and instructions for use

## CE-Marking
When the product is classified and meets the conformity checks, a CE-Marking shall be affixed to the device. This must be displayed in an indelible way on the device as well as on the instructions and sales packaging of the device. It should be accompanied by the identification number of the authority from which it was received, i.e MHRA. If other markings are affixed to the device then they cannot affect the visibility or legibility of the CE-Marking.

## Clinical Evaluation
Since our product is not a class III device which requires a full clinical trial, this stage can be achieved by providing a critical investigation of the current literature relating to the safety of current devices on the market and demonstrating the equivalence to our device.

## Risk Analysis
A complete risk analysis is required for the acquiring the CE-Marking. This must include assessment of all the potential hazards in the use of the device.
