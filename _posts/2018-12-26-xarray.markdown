***This post is now available on <a href="https://medium.com/@edenau/handling-netcdf-files-using-xarray-for-absolute-beginners-111a8ab4463f" target="_blank">Medium</a>. Check it out!***

# Introduction

NetCDF is a machine-independent, array-oriented, multi-dimensional, self-describing, and portable data format used by various scientific communities. It has a filename extension of *.nc* or *.cdf* (though it is believed that there are subtle differences between the two). Unlike files in *.csv* or *.xlsx*, NetCDF format cannot be accessed and viewed directly using spreadsheet software.
>Even if you could, you would not do that on a 4-dimensional data with a bunch of metadata.

I will take climate data from <a href="https://www.arm.gov/" target="_blank">*Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Climate Research Facility*</a> (ARM) in the United States, and <a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/" target="_blank">*European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts*</a> (ECMWF) in Europe as an example.

# Prerequisites

We will use `xarray` library in Python for data processing. Long story short, it builds upon `numpy` (and `dask`) libraries and leverages the power of `pandas`, but you probably don’t need to know about it. As you might know, package dependency is a pain in Python. That is why the most convenient way to get everything installed is to use the following command:

```
$ conda install xarray dask netCDF4 bottleneck
```

Experienced Python programmers are recommended check the relevant <a href="http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/installing.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> for more details. If you are a beginner, no worries. I made a list of dependencies that you need to check:
- ***Python 2.7/3.5+*** required
- ***numpy 1.12+*** required
- ***pandas 0.19.2+*** required
- ***scipy*** for interpolation features
- ***bottleneck*** for speeding up NaN-skipping
- ***netCDF4-python*** for basic netCDF operation such as reading/writing
- ***dask-array 0.16+*** for parallel computing with *dask*

If you want to visualize your dataset, you will probably need these:
- ***matplotlib 1.5+*** for plotting
- ***cartopy*** for maps
- ***seaborn*** for better colour palettes

For absolute beginners, you can check your default version of Python by
```
$ python --version
Python 2.7.5
```
You can also check if Python3 is installed by
```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.4.9
```
To check the version of packages, use `pip freeze` or `conda list`. Things should check out if you install `xarray` through `conda`.

# Alternatives

<a href="https://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/" target="_blank">`iris`</a> is an alternative to `xarray`, but some works need to be done to make it work on Windows, and it does not work well on Mac OS. Iris is also an English word, so googling ‘iris’ gives you many irrelevant results. It was a pain for me to use `iris`.

# Data Preview

It is always a good idea to ‘preview’ and ‘get to know’ your data, its metadata and data structures. Assume you have installed `netCDF4-python` and the only two commands you need are `ncdump` and `ncview`. The former gives text representation of your netCDF dataset (basically metadata and the data itself), while the latter is a very powerful graphical interface for instant data visualization.

## ncdump
Go to the directory of your dataset and try
```
$ ncdump -h twparmbeatmC1.c1.20050101.000000.cdf
```
As we do not need to see the values of every data entry at the moment, `-h` ensures only header (metadata) is shown. You will get
```
netcdf twparmbeatmC1.c1.20050101.000000 {
dimensions:
 time = UNLIMITED ; // (8760 currently)
 range = 2 ;
 p = 37 ;
 z = 512 ;
variables:
 double base_time ;
  base_time:long_name = "Base time in Epoch" ;
  base_time:units = "seconds since 1970-1-1 0:00:00 0:00" ;
  base_time:string = "2005-01-01 00.00, GMT" ;
  base_time:ancillary_variables = "time_offset" ;
 float prec_sfc(time) ;
  prec_sfc:long_name = "Precipitation Rate" ;
  prec_sfc:standard_name = "lwe_precipitation_rate" ;
  prec_sfc:units = "mm/hour" ;
  prec_sfc:missing_value = -9999.f ;
  prec_sfc:_FillValue = -9999.f ;
  prec_sfc:source = "twpsmet60sC1.b1" ;
 float T_p(time, p) ;
  T_p:long_name = "Dry Bulb Temperature, from sounding in p coordinate" ;
  T_p:standard_name = "air_temperature" ;
  T_p:units = "K" ;
  T_p:missing_value = -9999.f ;
  T_p:_FillValue = -9999.f ;
  T_p:source = "twpsondewnpnC1.b1:tdry" ;
// global attributes:
***< OTHER METADATA >***
}
```
You can see dimensions, variables, and other metadata which are quite self-explanatory. Global attributes (not printed above) tells us how the data is collected and pre-processed. In this example, they are measurement data taken at 147.4E 2.1S, Manus, Papua New Guinea by ARM.

When we look into the list of variables: 1-dim `prec_sfc` and 2-dim `T_p`, we realize that they have different dimensions(!). Precipitation rate is a scalar measurement at each time, whereas temperature is column (measurements at different pressure levels instead of altitude levels this time) at every time. It is quite common to see 4-dim data in climate science — latitude, longitude, altitude/pressure level, time.

## ncview
Try the following command and it gives you a graphical interface that lists all variables in your dataset, and it is quite straightforward.
```
$ ncview twparmbeatmC1.c1.20050101.000000.cdf
```

# Terminology

![Data structures of xarray]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/dataset-diagram.png)

## DataArray
`xarray.DataArray` is an implementation of a labelled, multi-dimensional array **for a single variable**, such as precipitation, temperature etc.. It has the following key properties:
- `values`: a `numpy.ndarray` holding the array’s values
- `dims`: dimension names for each axis (e.g., ``('lat', 'lon', 'z', 'time')``)
- `coords`: a dict-like container of arrays (coordinates) that label each point (e.g., 1-dim arrays of numbers, *DateTime* objects, or strings)
- `attrs`: an `OrderedDict` to hold arbitrary metadata (attributes)

## DataSet
`xarray.DataSet` is a collection of DataArrays. Each NetCDF file contains a DataSet.

# Coding using XArray

## Data Import
You cannot play with the data until you read it. Use `open_dataset` or `open_mfdataset` to read a single or multiple NetCDF files, and store it in a DataSet called `DS`.
```
import xarray as xr
# single file
dataDIR = '../data/ARM/twparmbeatmC1.c1.20050101.000000.cdf'
DS = xr.open_dataset(dataDIR)

# OR multiple files
mfdataDIR = '../data/ARM/twparmbeatmC1.c1.*.000000.cdf'
DS = xr.open_mfdataset(mfdataDIR)
```

## Data Inspection
Remember the 4 key properties of DataArrays? You can use `DS.values`, `DS.var`, `DS.dims`, `DS.coords`, and `DS.attrs` for data inspection. This will become very handy in interactive Python. Their functionalities are quite obvious and are left as an exercise to the reader(!).

## DataArray Extraction
Extracting DataArrays from DataSet `DS` is very straightforward, as `DS.<var_name>` will suffice. You might consider dropping NaN entries by `dropna()` and selecting data with `sel()`. The method parameter in `sel()` allows us to enable nearest neighbour (inexact) lookups by use of the methods `'pad'`, `'backfill'`, or `'nearest'`. To specify a range, use `slice()`.

You can transform `xr.DataArray` to `numpy.ndarray` by `da.values`.
```
# Extract Dry Bulb Temperature in z-coordinate (T_z)
# Select the altitude nearest to 500m above surface
# Drop NaN, convert to Celcius
da = DS.T_z.sel(z=500,method='nearest').dropna(dim='time') - 273.15  # or .ffill(dim='time')

# Select data in 2000s
da = da.sel(time=slice('2000-01-01', '2009-12-31'))
da_numpy = da.values
```

It is a convention to name DataSet as `DS` in upper case and DataArray as `da` in lower case.

## DateTime Operation
Assume DataArray `da` has a dimension `time` in *DateTime* format, We can extract the *year/month/day/dayofyear/dayofweek* by `da.time.dt.<year/month/day/...>`. Note that the output is still in DataArray.

The following example takes one step further and tries to compute the mean/sum of any variable for each month. We first define a new coordinate system with `assign_coords()`. Why? Try look into how *year* and *month* performs in *DateTime*. If we need the system to be aware of the differences between January 2000 and January 2001, we need both *year* and *month* to define a new coordinate, which we call it `year_month`.

We can then group data by `groupby('year_month')` based on our newly defined coordinate system, followed by `mean()` or `sum()` operations.
```
# Contract the DataArray by taking mean for each Year-Month
def mean_in_year_month(da):
    # Index of Year-Month starts at Jan 1991
    month_cnt_1991 = (da.time.dt.year.to_index() - 1991) * 12 + da.time.dt.month.to_index()
    # Assign newly defined Year-Month to coordinates, then group by it, then take the mean
    return da.assign_coords(year_month = month_cnt_1991).groupby('year_month').mean()

da_1 = mean_in_year_month(da1)
```

## DataArray Merging
We can merge multiple DataArrays using `xr.merge()`. If you attempt to merge two variables with the same name but with different values, `xr.MergeError` will be raised. This ensures `xr.merge()` is non-destructive.
```
DS_new = xr.merge([da_1,da_2,da_3]).dropna(dim='year_month')
```

## Plotting
You can simply take DataArrays as arguments of `matplotlib.pyplot` methods. For absolute beginners, try `plt.plot()`, or `plt.scatter()` for line or scatter plots. Remember to show figures by `plt.show()`, or save figures by `plt.savefig()`.

If you need maps, `cartopy` library can generate one easily.
```
import cartopy.crs as ccrs
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

da = DS.t_sfc

# Draw coastlines of the Earth
ax = plt.axes(projection=ccrs.PlateCarree())
ax.coastlines()
da.plot()
plt.show()
```

With a few extra lines of codes, you can generate something like this:

![Plots generated by cartopy]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/cartopy.png)

## Data Export
You can convert DataArray to `numpy.ndarray` as explained earlier, or convert DataSet or DataArray to `pandas.DataFrame` as illustrated below.
```
df = DS.to_dataframe()
```

You can also export DataArray or DataSet to NetCDF file by
```
dataDIR = '../data/new.nc'
DS.to_netcdf(dataDIR)
```
